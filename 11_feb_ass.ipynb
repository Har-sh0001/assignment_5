    "Question No .1:\n",
    "Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In Python, we use the open() method to open files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dfferent modes of opering a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "r: Open a file for reading.\n",
    "w : Open a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if exists.\n",
    "x : Open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.\n",
    "a : Open a file for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "t : Open in text mode.\n",
    "b : Open in binary mode.\n",
    "+ : Open a file for updating (reading and writing)\n",
    "Question No. 2:\n",
    "Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:When we are done with the opened file, we need to close it. If it is not closed the resources that are tied with the file are not freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the close() method is used to close a file. When you're done reading from or writing to a file, you need to close it so that other programs can access it and so that your program frees up the memory it used for the file.\n",

When the block of code is executed, the file is automatically closed, even if an exception is raised. This helps prevent resource leaks and reduces the risk of data corruption."
